# UnityCodeSnippets
A collection of various code snippets that can be used with Unity and Visual Studio

Ths repository contains various code snippets for some commonly used Unity tasks. They can be added into Visual Studio in order to re-use the snippets without having to type them each time.

More will probably be added over time.

# Setup

To get the code snippets into Visual Studio, you simply need to copy them into the "My Code Snippets" folder which can be found - \Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Code Snippets\Visual Basic\My Code Snippets

They can be pasted directly into that folder or they can be in sub-folders depending on your preferences. You only need to paste the code snippets you want to use into the folder too so you can ignore any you don't want.

# Use

I find there's 2 easy ways to use code snippets. Using the shortcut which is defined in the snippet file within the "shortcut" element. Typing the shortcut and then pressing tab will replace the shortcut with the snippet. Also, pressing Ctrl+K,S will bring up the Intellisense code snippet menu where you can select a snippet to use.

# Usage

Feel free to use any of these code snippets in any projects you work on, regardless of whether they are commercial projects or not. Also, feel free to modify them for your own usage. There is no need to provide credit or reference this repository is you don't want to.
